# classification-rockpaperscissors

## Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify images of rock, paper, and scissors. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of the three categories. The primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting the correct class of a given image.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and validation consists of images of rock, paper, and scissors. It is divided into training and validation sets to assess the model's performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model is designed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It includes layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected networks to extract features and make predictions.
